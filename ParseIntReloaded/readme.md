This is an old solution I am very proud of. It was my first considerable assembly
program that I ever wrote. When I look back to it it is not that a big deal, but
it helped me to learn so many things.

Basically what it does it that it takes a number in the following form:
"one hundred and twenty two" and converts it into 122. It works for numbers as big
as one billion.. from what I remember.
